    <string name="aleinu_english">It is our duty to praise the Lord of all things, to ascribe greatness to Him who formed the world in the beginning, since he has not made us like the nations of other lands, and has not placed us like other families of the earth; since he has not assigned to us a portion as to them, nor a lot as to all their multitude. For they bow to vanity and emptiness, and pray to a god who does not save. But we bend the knee and offer worship and thanks before the supreme King of kings, the Holy One, blessed be He, who stretched forth the heavens and laid the foundations of the earth, the seat of whose glory is in the heavens above, and the abode of whose might is in the loftiest heights. He is our God; there is none else: in truth He is our King; there is none besides Him; as it is written in His Law, And you shall know this day, and lay it to your heart, that the Lord is God in heaven above and upon the earth beneath: there is none else.\n\n\nWe therefore hope in You, O Lord our God, that we may speedily behold the glory of Your might, when You will remove the abominations from the earth and the idols will be utterly cut off, when the world will be perfected under the kingdom of the Almighty and all the children of flesh will call upon Your name, then You will turn to Yourself all the wicked of the earth. Let all the inhabitants of the world perceive and know that to You every knee must bow, every tongue must swear. Before You, O Lord our God, let them bow and fall; and to Your glorious name let them give honor; let them all accept the yoke of Your kingdom, and may You reign over them speedily, and forever and ever. For the kingdom is Yours, and for all eternity You will reign in glory; as it is written in Your Law, The Lord shall reign forever and ever. And it is said, And the Lord shall be king over all the earth: in that day shall the Lord be One, and his name One.\n\n\n</string>

       <item>A Psalm of Asaph. Surely God is good to Israel, even to such as are pure in heart.\nBut as for me, my feet were almost gone; my steps had well nigh slipped.\nFor I was envious at the arrogant, when I saw the prosperity of the wicked.\nFor there are no pangs at their death, and their body is sound.\nIn the trouble of man they are not; neither are they plagued like men.\nTherefore pride is as a chain about their neck; violence covereth them as a garment.\nTheir eyes stand forth from fatness; they are gone beyond the imaginations of their heart.\nThey scoff, and in wickedness utter oppression; they speak as if there were none on high.\nThey have set their mouth against the heavens, and their tongue walketh through the earth.\nTherefore His people return hither; and waters of fullness are drained out by them.\nAnd they say: \’How doth God know? And is there knowledge in the Most High?\’\nBehold, such are the wicked; and they that are always at ease increase riches.\nSurely in vain have I cleansed my heart, and washed my hands in innocency;\nFor all the day have I been plagued, and my chastisement came every morning.\nIf I had said: \’I will speak thus\’, behold, I had been faithless to the generation of Thy children.\nAnd when I pondered how I might know this, it was wearisome in mine eyes;\nUntil I entered into the sanctuary of God, and considered their end.\nSurely Thou settest them in slippery places; Thou hurlest them down to utter ruin.\nHow are they become a desolation in a moment! They are wholly consumed by terrors.\nAs a dream when one awaketh, so, O Lord, when Thou arousest Thyself, Thou wilt despise their semblance.\nFor my heart was in a ferment, and I was pricked in my reins.\nBut I was brutish, and ignorant; I was as a beast before Thee.\nNevertheless I am continually with Thee; Thou holdest my right hand.\nThou wilt guide me with Thy counsel, and afterward receive me with glory.\nWhom have I in heaven but Thee? And beside Thee I desire none upon earth.\nMy flesh and my heart faileth; but God is the rock of my heart and my portion for ever.\nFor, lo, they that go far from Thee shall perish; Thou dost destroy all them that go astray from Thee.\nBut as for me, the nearness of God is my good; I have made the Lord GOD my refuge, that I may tell of all Thy works.\n</item>

Shall the enemy blaspheme Thy name for ever?\nWhy withdrawest Thou Thy hand, even Thy right hand? Draw it out of Thy bosom and consume them.\nYet God is my King of old, working salvation in the midst of the earth.\nThou didst break the sea in pieces by Thy strength; Thou didst shatter the heads of the sea-monsters in the waters.\nThou didst crush the heads of leviathan, Thou gavest him to be food to the folk inhabiting the wilderness.\nThou didst cleave fountain and brook; Thou driedst up ever-flowing rivers.\nThine is the day, Thine also the night; Thou hast established luminary and sun.\nThou hast set all the borders of the earth; Thou hast made summer and winter.\nRemember this, how the enemy hath reproached the Lord, and how a base people have blasphemed Thy name.\nO deliver not the soul of Thy turtle-dove unto the wild beast; forget not the life of Thy poor for ever.\nLook upon the covenant; for the dark places of the land are full of the habitations of violence.\nO let not the oppressed turn back in confusion; let the poor and needy praise Thy name.\nArise, O God, plead Thine own cause; remember Thy reproach all the day at the hand of the base man.\nForget not the voice of Thine adversaries, the tumult of those that rise up against Thee which ascendeth continually.\n</item>

       <item>Maschil of Asaph. Give ear, O my people, to my teaching; incline your ears to the words of my mouth.\nI will open my mouth with a parable; I will utter dark sayings concerning days of old;\nThat which we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us,\nWe will not hide from their children, telling to the generation to come the praises of the Lord, and His strength, and His wondrous works that He hath done.\nFor He established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law in Israel, which He commanded our fathers, that they should make them known to their children;\nThat the generation to come might know them, even the children that should be born; who should arise and tell them to their children,\nThat they might put their confidence in God, and not forget the works of God, but keep His commandments;\nAnd might not be as their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation; a generation that set not their heart aright, and whose spirit was not stedfast with God.\nThe children of Ephraim were as archers handling the bow, that turned back in the day of battle.\nThey kept not the covenant of God, and refused to walk in His law;\nAnd they forgot His doings, and His wondrous works that He had shown them.\nMarvellous things did He in the sight of their fathers, in the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan.\nHe cleaved the sea, and caused them to pass through; and He made the waters to stand as a heap.\nBy day also He led them with a cloud, and all the night with a light of fire.\nHe cleaved rocks in the wilderness, and gave them drink abundantly as out of the great deep.\nHe brought streams also out of the rock, and caused waters to run down like rivers.\nYet went they on still to sin against Him, to rebel against the Most High in the desert.\nAnd they tried God in their heart by asking food for their craving.\nYea, they spoke against God; they said: \’Can God prepare a table in the wilderness?\nBehold, He smote the rock, that waters gushed out, and streams overflowed; can He give bread also? or will He provide flesh for His people?\’\nTherefore the Lord heard, and was wroth; and a fire was kindled against Jacob, and anger also went up against Israel;\nBecause they believed not in God, and trusted not in His salvation.\nAnd He commanded the skies above, and opened the doors of heaven;\nAnd He caused manna to rain upon them for food, and gave them of the corn of heaven.\nMan did eat the bread of the mighty; He sent them provisions to the full.\nHe caused the east wind to set forth in heaven; and by His power He brought on the south wind.\nHe caused flesh also to rain upon them as the dust, and winged fowl as the sand of the seas;\nAnd He let it fall in the midst of their camp, round about their dwellings.\nSo they did eat, and were well filled; and He gave them that which they craved.\nThey were not estranged from their craving, their food was yet in their mouths,\nWhen the anger of God went up against them, and slew of the lustieth among them, and smote down the young men of Israel.\nFor all this they sinned still, and believed not in His wondrous works.\nTherefore He ended their days as a breath, and their years in terror.\nWhen He slew them, then they would inquire after Him, and turn back and seek God earnestly.\nAnd they remembered that God was their Rock, and the Most High God their redeemer.\nBut they beguiled Him with their mouth, and lied unto Him with their tongue.\nFor their heart was not stedfast with Him, neither were they faithful in His covenant.\nBut He, being full of compassion, forgiveth iniquity, and destroyeth not; yea, many a time doth He turn His anger away, and doth not stir up all His wrath.\nSo He remembered that they were but flesh, a wind that passeth away, and cometh not again.\nHow oft did they rebel against Him in the wilderness, and grieve Him in the desert!\nAnd still again they tried God, and set bounds to the Holy One of Israel.\nThey remembered not His hand, nor the day when He redeemed them from the adversary.\nHow He set His signs in Egypt, and His wonders in the field of Zoan;\nAnd turned their rivers into blood, so that they could not drink their streams.\nHe sent among them swarms of flies, which devoured them; and frogs, which destroyed them.\nHe gave also their increase unto the caterpillar, and their labour unto the locust.\nHe destroyed their vines with hail, and their sycamore-trees with frost.\nHe gave over their cattle also to the hail, and their flocks to fiery bolts.\nHe sent forth upon them the fierceness of His anger, wrath, and indignation, and trouble, a sending of messengers of evil.\nHe levelled a path for His anger; He spared not their soul from death, but gave their life over to the pestilence;\nAnd smote all the first-born in Egypt, the first-fruits of their strength in the tents of Ham;\nBut He made His own people to go forth like sheep, and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.\nAnd He led them safely, and they feared not; but the sea overwhelmed their enemies.\nAnd He brought them to His holy border, to the mountain, which His right hand had gotten.\nHe drove out the nations also before them, and allotted them for an inheritance by line, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.\nYet they tried and provoked God, the Most High, and kept not His testimonies;\nBut turned back, and dealt treacherously like their fathers; they were turned aside like a deceitful bow.\nFor they provoked Him with their high places, and moved Him to jealousy with their graven images.\nGod heard, and was wroth, and He greatly abhorred Israel;\nAnd He forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent which He had made to dwell among men;\nAnd delivered His strength into captivity, and His glory into the adversary\’s hand.\nHe gave His people over also unto the sword; and was wroth with His inheritance.\nFire devoured their young men; and their virgins had no marriage-song.\nTheir priests fell by the sword; and their widows made no lamentation.\nThen the Lord awaked as one asleep, like a mighty man recovering from wine.\nAnd He smote His adversaries backward; He put upon them a perpetual reproach.\nMoreover He abhorred the tent of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim;\nBut chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which He loved.\nAnd He built His sanctuary like the heights, like the earth which He hath founded for ever.\nHe chose David also His servant, and took him from the sheepfolds;\nFrom following the ewes that give suck He brought him, to be shepherd over Jacob His people, and Israel His inheritance.\nSo he shepherded them according to the integrity of his heart; and lead them by the skilfulness of his hands.\n</item>
       <item>A Psalm of Asaph. O God, the heathen are come into Thine inheritance; they have defiled Thy holy temple; they have made Jerusalem into heaps.\nThey have given the dead bodies of Thy servants to be food unto the fowls of the heaven, the flesh of Thy saints unto the beasts of the earth.\nThey have shed their blood like water round about Jerusalem, with none to bury them.\nWe are become a taunt to our neighbours, a scorn and derision to them that are round about us.\nHow long, O the Lord, wilt Thou be angry for ever? How long will Thy jealousy burn like fire?\nPour out Thy wrath upon the nations that know Thee not, and upon the kingdoms that call not upon Thy name.\nFor they have devoured Jacob, and laid waste his habitation.\nRemember not against us the iniquities of our forefathers; let Thy compassions speedily come to meet us; for we are brought very low.\nHelp us, O God of our salvation, for the sake of the glory of Thy name; and deliver us, and forgive our sins, for Thy name\’s sake.\nWherefore should the nations say: \’Where is their God?\’ Let the avenging of Thy servants\’ blood that is shed be made known among the nations in our sight.\nLet the groaning of the prisoner come before Thee; according to the greatness of Thy power set free those that are appointed to death;\nAnd render unto our neighbours sevenfold into their bosom their reproach, wherewith they have reproached Thee, O Lord.\nSo we that are Thy people and the flock of Thy pasture will give Thee thanks for ever; we will tell of Thy praise to all generations.\n</item>

Maschil of Heman the Ezrahite.\nO the Lord, God of my salvation, what time I cry in the night before Thee,\nLet my prayer come before Thee, incline Thine ear unto my cry.\nFor my soul is sated with troubles, and my life draweth nigh unto the grave.\nI am counted with them that go down into the pit; I am become as a man that hath no help;\nSet apart among the dead, like the slain that lie in the grave, whom Thou rememberest no more; and they are cut off from Thy hand.\nThou hast laid me in the nether-most pit, in dark places, in the deeps.\nThy wrath lieth hard upon me, and all Thy waves Thou pressest down. Selah\nThou hast put mine acquaintance far from me; Thou hast made me an abomination unto them; I am shut up, and I cannot come forth.\nMine eye languisheth by reason of affliction; I have called upon Thee, O the Lord, every day, I have spread forth my hands unto Thee.\nWilt Thou work wonders for the dead? Or shall the shades arise and give Thee thanks? Selah\nShall Thy mercy be declared in the grave? or Thy faithfulness in destruction?\nShall Thy wonders be known in the dark? and Thy righteousness in the land of forgetfulness?\nBut as for me, unto Thee, O the Lord, do I cry, and in the morning doth my prayer come to meet Thee.\nthe Lord, why castest Thou off my soul? Why hidest Thou Thy face from me?\nI am afflicted and at the point of death from my youth up; I have borne Thy terrors, I am distracted.\nThy fierce wrath is gone over me; Thy terrors have cut me off.\nThey came round about me like water all the day; they compassed me about together.\nFriend and companion hast Thou put far from me, and mine acquaintance into darkness.\n</item>

O give thanks unto the Lord; for He is good; for His mercy endureth for ever.\nWho can express the mighty acts of the Lord, or make all His praise to be heard?\nHappy are they that keep justice, that do righteousness at all times.\nRemember me, O the Lord, when Thou favourest Thy people; O think of me at Thy salvation;\nThat I may behold the prosperity of Thy chosen, that I may rejoice in the gladness of Thy nation, that I may glory with Thine inheritance.\nWe have sinned with our fathers, we have done iniquitously, we have dealt wickedly.\nOur fathers in Egypt gave no heed unto Thy wonders; they remembered not the multitude of Thy mercies; but were rebellious at the sea, even at the Red Sea.\nNevertheless He saved them for His name\’s sake, that He might make His mighty power to be known.\nAnd He rebuked the Red Sea, and it was dried up; and He led them through the depths, as through a wilderness.\nAnd He saved them from the hand of him that hated them, and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.\nAnd the waters covered their adversaries; there was not one of them left.\nThen believed they His words; they sang His praise.\nThey soon forgot His works; they waited not for His counsel;\nBut lusted exceedingly in the wilderness, and tried God in the desert.\nAnd He gave them their request; but sent leanness into their soul.\nThey were jealous also of Moses in the camp, and of Aaron the holy one of the Lord.\nThe earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, and covered the company of Abiram.\nAnd a fire was kindled in their company; the flame burned up the wicked.\nThey made a calf in Horeb, and worshipped a molten image.\nThus they exchanged their glory for the likeness of an ox that eateth grass.\nThey forgot God their saviour, who had done great things in Egypt;\nWondrous works in the land of Ham, terrible things by the Red Sea.\nTherefore He said that He would destroy them, had not Moses His chosen stood before Him in the breach, to turn back His wrath, lest He should destroy them.\nMoreover, they scorned the desirable land, they believed not His word;\nAnd they murmured in their tents, they hearkened not unto the voice of the Lord.\nTherefore He swore concerning them, that He would overthrow them in the wilderness;\nAnd that He would cast out their seed among the nations, and scatter them in the lands.\nThey joined themselves also unto Baal of Peor, and ate the sacrifices of the dead.\nThus they provoked Him with their doings, and the plague broke in upon them.\nThen stood up Phinehas, and wrought judgment, and so the plague was stayed.\nAnd that was counted unto him for righteousness, unto all generations for ever.\nThey angered Him also at the waters of Meribah, and it went ill with Moses because of them;\nFor they embittered his spirit, and he spoke rashly with his lips.\nThey did not destroy the peoples, as the Lord commanded them;\nBut mingled themselves with the nations, and learned their works;\nAnd they served their idols, which became a snare unto them;\nYea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto demons,\nAnd shed innocent blood, even the blood of their sons and of their daughters, whom they sacrificed unto the idols of Canaan; and the land was polluted with blood.\nThus were they defiled with their works, and went astray in their doings.\nTherefore was the wrath of the Lord kindled against His people, and He abhorred His inheritance.\nAnd He gave them into the hand of the nations; and they that hated them ruled over them.\nTheir enemies also oppressed them, and they were subdued under their hand.\nMany times did He deliver them; but they were rebellious in their counsel, and sank low through their iniquity.\nNevertheless He looked upon their distress, when He heard their cry;\nAnd He remembered for them His covenant, and repented according to the multitude of His mercies.\nHe made them also to be pitied of all those that carried them captive.\nSave us, O the Lord our God, and gather us from among the nations, that we may give thanks unto Thy holy name, that we may triumph in Thy praise.\nBlessed be the Lord, the God of Israel, from everlasting even to everlasting, and let all the people say: \’Amen.\’ Hallelujah.\n</item>

Sing unto the Lord a new song, and His praise in the assembly of the saints.\nLet Israel rejoice in his Maker; let the children of Zion be joyful in their King.\nLet them praise His name in the dance; let them sing praises unto Him with the timbrel and harp.\nFor the Lord taketh pleasure in His people; He adorneth the humble with salvation.\nLet the saints exult in glory; let them sing for joy upon their beds.\nLet the high praises of God be in their mouth, and a two-edged sword in their hand;\nTo execute vengeance upon the nations, and chastisements upon the peoples;\nTo bind their kings with chains, and their nobles with fetters of iron;\nTo execute upon them the judgment written; He is the glory of all His saints. Hallelujah.\n</item>
       <item>Hallelujah. Praise God in His sanctuary; praise Him in the firmament of His power.\nPraise Him for His mighty acts; praise Him according to His abundant greatness.\nPraise Him with the blast of the horn; praise Him with the psaltery and harp.\nPraise Him with the timbrel and dance; praise Him with stringed instruments and the pipe.\nPraise Him with the loud-sounding cymbals; praise Him with the clanging cymbals.\nLet every thing that hath breath praise the Lord. Hallelujah.\n</item>
